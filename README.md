# project-library

Proyect was about showing a library of books and adding a filter and sorting.

The problem
I started with creating the boxes in the HTLM files to see how it would look likE.Then I changed my mind and I used a function to receive an array as a parameter to build the boxes with books. I add a filter function to filter by genre and two sorting function to sort by rating and year. I also played with Css to add shadow to the boxes and buttons.
